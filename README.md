# Keymoji
A floating emoji keyboard for Windows

Hello, and welcome.

Keymoji is a floating keyboard program which allows Windows user to send emoji much easier than using the On-Screen Keyboard shipped with Windows 8 and above or by copy & pasting emoji from the Internet.

Simply press the activation keys (default is CTRL + ALT + Space) and you can now use emoji in your Windows machine.
